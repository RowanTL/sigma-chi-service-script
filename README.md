# Overview

This is a script for calcuating service hours from a form. Copy and paste `service.ts`
into a new script in the code editor.

Email me if you need help future sigs. This is for the Theta Eta chapter of Sigma Chi.

## How to

Have a copy of the roster sheet named `RosterSheet`.
The roster table must be named `Roster`. Have a sheet for the
form named `ServiceSheet`. The service table must be named `Service`.
The form should ask *Amount of service hours* and
*Description of what person did*. **The questions have to be asked in that order** 
(unless you want to modify the code). Finally, have a sheet named
`TotalSheet`. The total amounts for each active will appear in `TotalSheet` after
this script is ran.
